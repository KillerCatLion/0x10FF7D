This set of programs is used to automatically manage my server's mods on the client side. This makes it easy for me to add/remove mods and the players won't have to do anything. Easier for me, easier for them.

The java.exe program is used to trick the minecraft launcher into running the mod update program first, It's named java.exe because Minecraft would not launch unless I named it java.exe.
